Array of indexes, [['a', 1]] etc.\n *  - **hint**  {Object}, hint force the query to use a specific index.\n *  - **explain** {Boolean}, explain return the explaination of the query.\n *  - **snapshot** {Boolean}, snapshot Snapshot mode assures no duplicates are returned.\n *  - **timeout** {Boolean}, timeout allow the query to timeout.\n *  - **tailable** {Boolean}, tailable allow the cursor to be tailable.\n *  - **awaitdata** {Boolean}, awaitdata allow the cursor to wait for data, only applicable for tailable cursor.\n *  - **oplogReplay** {Boolean}, sets an internal flag, only applicable for tailable cursor.\n *  - **batchSize** {Number}, batchSize the number of the subset of results to request the database to return for every request. This should initially be greater than 1 otherwise the database will automatically close the cursor. The batch size can be set to 1 with cursorInstance.batchSize after performing the initial query to the database.\n *  - **raw** {Boolean}, raw return all query documents as raw buffers (default false).\n *  - **read** {Boolean}, read specify override of read from source (primary/secondary).\n *  - **returnKey** {Boolean}, returnKey only return the index key.\n *  - **maxScan** {Number}, maxScan limit the number of items to scan.\n *  - **min** {Number}, min set index bounds.\n *  - **max** {Number}, max set index bounds.\n *  - **maxTimeMS** {Number}, number of miliseconds to wait before aborting the query.\n *  - **showDiskLoc** {Boolean}, showDiskLoc show disk location of results.\n *  - **comment** {String}, comment you can put a $comment field on a query to make looking in the profiler logs simpler.\n *  - **numberOfRetries** {Number}, numberOfRetries if using awaidata specifies the number of times to retry on timeout.\n *  - **dbName** {String}, dbName override the default dbName.\n *  - **tailableRetryInterval** {Number}, tailableRetryInterval specify the miliseconds between getMores on tailable cursor.\n *  - **exhaust** {Boolean}, exhaust have the server send all the documents at once as getMore packets.\n *  - **partial** {Boolean}, partial have the sharded system return a partial result from mongos.\n *\n * @class Represents a Cursor.\n * @param {Db} db the database object to work with.\n * @param {Collection} collection the collection to query.\n * @param {Object} selector the query selector.\n * @param {Object} fields an object containing what fields to include or exclude from objects returned.\n * @param {Object} [options] additional options for the collection.\n*/\nfunction Cursor(db, collection, selector, fields, options) {\n  this.db = db;\n  this.collection = collection;\n  this.selector = selector;\n  this.fields = fields;\n  options = !options ? {} : options;\n\n  this.skipValue = options.skip == null ? 0 : options.skip;\n  this.limitValue = options.limit == null ? 0 : options.limit;\n  this.sortValue = options.sort;\n  this.hint = options.hint;\n  this.explainValue = options.explain;\n  this.snapshot = options.snapshot;\n  this.timeout = options.timeout == null ? true : options.timeout;\n  this.tailable = options.tailable;\n  this.awaitdata = options.awaitdata;\n  this.oplogReplay = options.oplogReplay;\n  this.numberOfRetries = options.numberOfRetries == null ? 5 : options.numberOfRetries;\n  this.currentNumberOfRetries = this.numberOfRetries;\n  this.batchSizeValue = options.batchSize == null ? 0 : options.batchSize;\n  this.raw = options.raw == null ? false : options.raw;\n  this.readPreference = options.readPreference == null ?

For operations like addition and\n * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be\n * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\n * or change in sign.\n *\n * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\n * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\n * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\n * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\n * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this\n * case would often result in infinite recursion.\n *\n * @class Represents the BSON Long type.\n * @param {number} low  the low (signed) 32 bits of the Long.\n * @param {number}

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined)\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  var ts = this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('finish', function() {\n    if ('function' === typeof this._flush)\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.
